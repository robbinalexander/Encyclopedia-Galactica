How to manage multiple git accounts on the same machine

* Delete existing keys

```
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-add -D
$ rm -rf *
```

* Generate keys for multiple accounts
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <personal-email-address>
# Save it as id_rsa_personal
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <work-email-address>
# Save it as id_rsa_work
```

* You should be able to see 2 files for each of your accounts
```
$ ls -la ~/.ssh/
-rw-------   1 ra  staff  1679 Jul  6 18:15 id_rsa_personal
-rw-r--r--   1 ra  staff   408 Jul  6 18:15 id_rsa_personal.pub
-rw-------   1 ra  staff  1675 Jul  6 18:15 id_rsa_work
-rw-r--r--   1 ra  staff   417 Jul  6 18:15 id_rsa_work.pub
```
* Add the generated public keys to each of your git accounts (multiple github, bitbucket, etc. accounts). For eg. for github, navigate to settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> Click on New SSH key -> paste the text ofÂ .pub -> Add SSH key
* Create a config file under ~/.ssh/
```
$ vi ~/.ssh/config
#personal
Host personal
    Hostname github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
#work
Host work
    Hostname github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

* Add the new identities
```
$ ssh-add id_rsa_personal
Identity added: id_rsa_personal (id_rsa_personal)
$ ssh-add id_rsa_work
Identity added: id_rsa_work (id_rsa_work)
#test using ssh-add -l
```
